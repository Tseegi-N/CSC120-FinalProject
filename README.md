# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase - Actions, Location, BadPlace, and Goodplace classes
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram - Diagram.pdf
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
We could have let the player to roll the dice, but because the game is a text-based program, it seemed impractical. 
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable) - TileMap
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 -- What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
Because we had to build the code in an OOP system, we had to figure out the assembling of our game – specifically how tiles, questions, and answers relate to each other – before we started our program. Also, we had to figure out the association between the ASCII arts and the Action class.  
 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
Random methods, ASCII art, and storing values in lists are few new things that we learned during our completion of this project. 
 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
If it wasn’t text-based, we feel like we could have added more visualization and easier/ inticing user interface for our game. 
 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?
Sound, graphics, and more detailed exploration when the player gets to the good/bad/medium places are what we would have liked to implement in our game. 
 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
Jordan - he suggested that we utilize a list, which helped us remove a roadblock in our project. 
 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?
Use lists, go to office hours, ask for help from our peers, and be open to suggestions are the main takeaways from our project. 
 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.
We did pair programming and contributed equally to the project. Moreover, we both debugged roadblocks that appeared during our programming. We are the Chidi-Eleanor couple in this world!!!
